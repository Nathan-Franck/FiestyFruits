Client joins
Server constructs colored images
	Check if images already exist
	Create new folder space for images
	Process all images and place in new folder
Server allows connect
Client retrieves colored images
	Retrieve from folder corresponding to playerid

Structure
	classes can have required graphics in the form of an array of objects
		name: name of texture variable in class
		loc:
	client/server compiles list of graphics required from all relevant classes

Best for coding
	1. class requires color coded image
	2. in class when a sprite graphic is created, it's created from a location: "bunny.png"
	var sprite = Graphics.CreateSprite({loc:"bunny.png", teamColor:true})
		The problem with this is that the server won't know immediatley what will be requested.

Bunny.requiredTextures(["bunny.png", "attack.png"]);
